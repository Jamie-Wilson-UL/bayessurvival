Description: Implements Bayesian imputation methodology for handling right-censored 
    survival data, treating censored observations as missing data and using Bayesian 
    methods to generate multiple completed datasets. Supports both parametric 
    (Weibull, lognormal, exponential) and nonparametric (Linear Dependent Dirichlet 
    Process) imputation approaches. Main entry point is the unified 'impute()' function. 
    Advanced users can access 'bayesian_impute()' for parametric models and 
    'bayes_np_impute()' for nonparametric models directly. Includes comprehensive 
    plotting methods for survival curves, density comparisons, and posterior 
    diagnostics. Enables standard statistical summaries and visualisations on 
    completed datasets, with export capabilities for multiple formats (CSV, RDS). 
    Includes simulation tools for method validation and performance assessment.
