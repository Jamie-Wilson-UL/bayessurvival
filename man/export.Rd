\usage{
export(
  object,
  file_path,
  format = c("csv", "rds"),
  datasets = "all",
  groups = "combined",
  include_original = TRUE,
  combine = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A bayesian_imputation object (from bayesian_impute or bayes_np_impute)}

\item{file_path}{Base file path}

\item{format}{Output format for saving ("csv", "rds")}

\item{datasets}{Which datasets to save ("all", "first", or specific numbers)}

\item{groups}{How to handle groups ("combined", "separate", or specific group name)}

\item{include_original}{Whether to include original value columns}

\item{combine}{If TRUE, write a single combined file across imputations. For RDS output, setting combine to FALSE will write one file per dataset when multiple datasets are requested.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to writing functions}
}
\value{
Invisible list with file paths of saved files
}
\description{
Export completed datasets from Bayesian imputation results in CSV or RDS
formats. Provides user-friendly options for saving imputed data for future
analysis.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Load and impute data
data(lung, package = "survival")
result <- bayesian_impute(lung, n_imputations = 5)

# Export all datasets as CSV files
export(result, "lung_imputed", format = "csv")

# Export as RDS for future R analysis
export(result, "lung_imputed", format = "rds")

# Export only first dataset
export(result, "lung_imputed", format = "csv", datasets = "first")

# For group analysis
result_groups <- bayesian_impute(data, groups = "treatment")
export(result_groups, "group_imputed", format = "csv", groups = "combined")
}
